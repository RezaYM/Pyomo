'''This problem uses the file ProblemData2.json. In this file are multiple knapsack
problem instances. Each instance is a dictionary with three fields
• size: a list of item sizes
• value: a list of item values
• capacity: the capacity of the knapsack
For each instance solve the IP and the LP relaxation. Report the largest integrality gap, the smallest
integrality gap, and the average integrality gap.
Identify the instance that achieves the smallest integrality gap.'''
